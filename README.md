Group 25 - Styling Choices

- Variable names and Function names: underscore naming
- Use curly brackets for all scope blocks (conditionals, loops etc)
- /* */ use these comments to describe a function's purpose
- Be sensible with commenting blocks of code (don't go overkill or underkill)
- Comment struct members 
- Capitalise comments
- Branch names must indicate the task you are carrying out
- No magic numbers, define in a constant in the .h files
- Enums capitalised and use underscores
- Always cast pointers explicitly when allocating memory
- int \*magical = (int\*) malloc(sizeof(*magical)); style for allocating memory
